   - HTTP Accessible: ‚úÖ Yes
   - Current Performance: 1 event found
   - Issues: Complex site with 17 scripts, iframes, and AJAX

2. **20000 Den-atsu** (https://den-atsu.com)
   - Complexity: simple (score: 1)
   - HTTP Accessible: ‚ùå No
   - Current Performance: 0 events found
   - Issues: Site blocks HTTP requests, requires browser automation despite simple structure

## Key Technical Findings

### Website Complexity Analysis
- **Very Complex (score 9)**: 2 venues (Antiknock, Yokohama Arena)
- **Complex (score 6)**: 1 venue (Milkyway)
- **Simple (score 1)**: 1 venue (Den-atsu, but requires JS due to access restrictions)

### Technical Characteristics
- **Scripts**: Range from 0-23 JavaScript files per venue
- **Iframes**: 0-8 iframes per venue
- **AJAX/Frameworks**: 75% use modern JavaScript frameworks
- **Calendar Systems**: 75% have calendar/date picker functionality

## Major Issues Identified

### 1. **Den-atsu Complete Failure** üö®
- **Problem**: Site appears simple but blocks HTTP requests
- **Current Status**: 0 events found
- **Root Cause**: Server-side access controls or CloudFlare protection

### 2. **Milkyway Date Filtering** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Problem**: Found 4 events but all filtered out as invalid/past dates
- **Current Status**: Technical success but no valid events
- **Root Cause**: Date parsing/validation logic too restrictive

### 3. **Low Event Volume** üìâ
- **Problem**: Only 8 total events across 4 major venues
- **Expected**: Should be 20-50+ events for major Tokyo venues
- **Root Cause**: Limited date range coverage, filtering issues

## Improvement Recommendations

### üöÄ High-Priority Optimizations

#### 1. **Fix Den-atsu Access Issues**
```ruby
# Potential solutions:
- Implement CloudFlare bypass techniques
- Use residential proxy rotation
- Add more realistic browser headers/fingerprinting
- Implement session management
```

#### 2. **Expand Date Range Coverage**
```ruby
# Current: Usually only current/next few days
# Target: Full month ahead (28-30 days)
# Implementation: Enhanced date URL generation
```

#### 3. **Fix Milkyway Date Validation**
```ruby
# Problem: Valid events being filtered as "past dates"
# Solution: Review date parsing logic for edge cases
# Add timezone handling for Japanese dates
```

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

#### 1. **Implement Hybrid Scraping Strategy**
```ruby
# Static-first approach:
1. Try HTTP + Nokogiri (3-5x faster)
2. Fallback to browser automation if needed
3. Cache complexity scores to optimize routing
```

#### 2. **Browser Optimization**
```ruby
# Current: Full Chrome automation for all venues
# Optimized:
- Headless mode by default
- Reduced wait times
- Disable images/css for content-only scraping
- Parallel venue processing
```

#### 3. **Smart Selector Enhancement**
```ruby
# Current: Generic selectors
# Enhanced: Venue-specific optimized selectors
# Learn from successful extractions
```

### üìä Scaling Recommendations

#### 1. **Add More Proven Venues**
Current proven venues are insufficient for Tokyo's live music scene. Need to identify and add:
- 10-15 additional high-quality venues
- Focus on venues with consistent event schedules
- Prioritize venues with good technical accessibility

#### 2. **Implement Quality Scoring**
```ruby
# Venue scoring system:
- Technical accessibility (40%)
- Event volume consistency (30%)
- Data quality (20%)
- Scraping reliability (10%)
```

#### 3. **Automated Monitoring**
```ruby
# Continuous monitoring:
- Daily scraping health checks
- Performance regression detection
- New venue discovery pipeline
- Failure alert system
```
